                I am an IT engineer and PHP/Laravel developer with a diverse background that combines technical
                expertise and leadership experience.
                Previously, I served as a Reserve Officer in the Armed Forces, where I developed strong discipline,
                leadership skills,
                and the ability to perform effectively under pressure. This military experience has enhanced my
                problem-solving capabilities
                and teamwork approach, which I apply daily in my IT and software development projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my programming skills, I have hands-on experience working with GPR Radar systems, which
                adds a unique technical dimension to my profile.
                I am passionate about leveraging my broad skill set to deliver innovative solutions and contribute
                effectively to any team or project.
